                    <em>Brackets is a different type of editor.</em>
                Brackets has some unique features like Quick Edit, Live Preview and others that you may not find in other
                editors. Brackets is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That means that most of you using Brackets
                have the skills necessary to modify and extend the editor. In fact, we use Brackets every day to build
                Brackets. To learn more about how to use the key features, read on.

                    <h3>Projects in Brackets</h3>
            <p>
                In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files.
                Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and
                Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder.
            </p>
            <samp>
                Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
                in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
                folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
                to open your own folder.
                You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
                sample project.
